					<p>We live in a world where technology is no longer a fickle toy that we use to escape from reality, but a full extension of our everyday routine. Cell phones have taken over task management, video games feel more real every year, and virtual reality is pushing the boundaries of our imagination faster than our brains can catch up. For someone like me (35), the evolution of technology almost feels surreal. The pixelated plumber or blue hedgehog of my childhood now feel further away than ever. Though let me not get sidetracked into nostalgia for we have all grown, and we have grown into an age of infinite possibilities in gaming.</p>

					<h2>Why Video Games are the Future Format of Narration</h2>
					<p>Games now offer something that is individual to their platform and that is the seamless integration of branching paths. Have you ever watched a movie and wished the main character had not taken the happy ending? Or finished a book and felt that the narrative fidelity did not line up? This is the limitations of a single narrative in other media and the flexibility in the narrative exploration of video games. Video games have become a masspersonal communication as they float between a hybrid of a mass-produced media and a personalized creation. In building our own individualistic sequence of actions, audiences control the stakes of the game's storyline into their own hands.</p>

					<h2>The New Benchmark "Baldur's Gate 3"</h2>
					<p>The game that has achieved this choice driven mechanic at the highest level is Baldur's Gate 3. Based on the tabletop role playing game Dungeons & Dragons, Baldur's Gate 3 brings to life the feeling of an open-ended adventure that revolves around quests and overcoming obstacles. In the land of Faerun, anything is possible. If you wanted to sell out the villagers to the goblins or pursue romantic advances with enemy warlords, go for it! The directors of Larian Studio, which is the company behind the creation of Baldur's Gate 3 have stated that it was not about the ending that they wanted to see happen personally but about the opportunities they wanted to give to the users to explore for themselves. (BAFTA) Thanks to Baldur's Gate 3's extensive layers of narrative structure players can structure the story through the conversations they have with the characters in the story. By encoding multiple layers of emotional themes on each character, the user could describe the companions in the storylines to be power hungry, trauma driven, misunderstood or a manipulative anti-hero based on the appropriation that you find within their scope. Negotiated readings of characters by users breed the endless possibilities to how your gameplay plays out in the end.</p>

				<h2>Storyline of Baldur's Gate 3 **No Spoilers**</h2>
				<p>The game is broken into three separate parts in a traditional three-act structure. In the Act I Setup, the player is found abducted by an alien race with a parasitic bug placed in their brain. The character must find a cure to their infection quickly or risk losing their autonomy. Then as you explore you find out that the world is being overrun by a new religion based around the worship of a questionable entity called the Absolute. In the Act II Confrontation, you are driven to investigate the origin of the religious uprising. Allies or enemies you have made will put your will to the test. Further exploring a world that has been plagued by the political turmoil of old is now being influenced by the powerful Absolute as you are left to find a path that that is aligned to your personal sense of duty. Finally, as you reach the Act III Resolution you move into the big city of Baldur's Gate where your character's past choices and the identity of the Absolute come to fruition. You shape the future of the city and see the outcomes of the character arcs you have driven forward across the finish line.</p>

					<h2>What Makes Baldur's Gate Beyond The Scope Of Just A Video Game?</h2>
					<p>Baldur's Gate 3 at the outermost level is a narratively driven masterpiece with branching paths, but in terms of media this definition only scratches the surface. It is a cultural landmark in modern media, driving the transition from a single narrative to a open ended narrative sandbox. This AAA title has shown to millions of users a video game that can become their own and live and breathe an original story every time. Alongside the story that a single player witnesses, BG3 becomes a media convergence as players can go online after and explore their path through the story by comparing it to other gamers. This community approach to the game's mechanic has given the game a depth beyond that of the single interpretation. It has given each character a web of interpretations and reactions demonstrating the complexity of the narrative itself while also reflects how this media has become a collaborative median with multiple layers of interactivity.</p>

				<h2>Our Final Mission As Gamers</h2>
				<p>This game is known to have 12 big endings with 17,000 variations. (Roberton, J 2023) This may sound like an exuberant number, but it is a real estimate done by the studio. New dialog options and varied endings are still being found every day, and this game is now three years old. This is the magic that we hold in our controllers as we adventure into the expanding world of gaming. We are no longer meant to be stuck at the mercy of the director's narrative structure; we are now the builders and reapers of our own quests. Will we be the hero that triumphs against evil or the dark lord that spreads chaos, who knows? We can only look forward to the next interaction to see where exactly our future lies.</p>
